    "The data indicate that skepticism toward official statistics and mainstream media experienced noticeable fluctuations throughout 2020, closely corresponding with key phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the early months of the year, public discussion around misinformation and distrust remained relatively stable. However, beginning in March 2020—when the pandemic was officially declared—there was a clear increase in the number of mentions of terms such as “fake news,” “propaganda,” “lies,” and “mainstream media.” This suggests that the health crisis and the accompanying information overload amplified public doubts about the credibility of institutional communication and media reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this surge slightly declined in mid-2020, skepticism remained consistently higher than pre-pandemic levels, with another peak visible toward the end of the year. This secondary rise likely reflects renewed tensions around political polarization, vaccine announcements, and continued debates over misinformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the evidence supports the conclusion that the COVID-19 pandemic acted as a catalyst for growing distrust in traditional information sources. The sustained visibility of skeptical discourse throughout 2020 illustrates how global crises can intensify public questioning of authority, expertise, and the reliability of official narratives."

    "The comparison of word frequencies between COVID-related and non-COVID conspiracy discussions reveals distinct linguistic patterns that reflect the specific focus and context of each topic. In COVID-related conspiracies, users more frequently use terms such as “virus,” “vaccine,” “vaccines,” and “covid,” which directly reference the health crisis and associated medical themes. This indicates a discourse centered on public health, disease transmission, and skepticism toward scientific or governmental handling of the pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, non-COVID conspiracy discussions are dominated by more general or socially oriented language, with higher frequencies for words such as “people,” “like,” “just,” and “think.” These words suggest broader discussions about human behavior, belief systems, and opinion-sharing rather than specific scientific or epidemiological issues.\n",

    "The data presented in the graph demonstrate that the presence of religious themes within conspiracy theory discussions fluctuated in close relation to major global events throughout 2020. Notably, during periods of intense socio-political and public health crises—such as the official declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic or the U.S. presidential election—the share of religious references declined significantly. This suggests that, in moments of acute global tension, conspiracy narratives tended to focus more on political, scientific, or institutional explanations rather than invoking religious frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, during religious holidays and spiritually symbolic dates—such as Easter Monday or the birthday of the 14th Dalai Lama—there was a clear rise in the frequency of religious rhetoric. These peaks imply that collective religious observances may serve as catalysts for renewed interest in theological or eschatological interpretations within conspiratorial discourse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the findings indicate that religious references in conspiracy discussions are not constant but context-dependent: they tend to diminish during periods dominated by secular crises and resurface during times of religious or spiritual significance. This pattern highlights the dynamic interaction between religion, collective emotion, and the search for meaning in the face of uncertainty."
